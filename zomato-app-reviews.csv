1,2020-06-30 08:51:21,I’ve been a happy and loyal customer with zomato for years! Until this week when 2 weeks in a row I had an issue with my order and instead of fixing the problem they just refunded my money instead of investigating the problem further. The first time the problem occurred I did receive a voucher which I used towards the second order. Then the problem occurred again and their representatives refused to send an additional voucher. Only to tell me my original voucher used would be returned in 2hrs and I needed to order from a different restaurant. So therefore you expect me to wait two hrs to order from a different restaurant and starve my kids til then in order to utilize the voucher. The problem could have been solved by simply gifting me another voucher since the same issue occurred 2 weeks in a row. It was my foolishness to think this problem had been solved and then to think I would receive the same courteous customer service when I did not. In my opinion the representative needed additional training as they were such in a rush to end our chat and care less that I was leaving the chat very unsatisfied!

 Lo and behold again today the same issue.

 Numerous issues occur where Zomato blames the restaurant and I know this is not true, since I call the restaurants to check. 
 If there is a slight drizzle of rain, zomato cancels the order blaming the restaurant, when in actuality the driver doesn’t show up. 
 One time the delivery driver actually dropped my order of donuts and actually opened the donut box and rearranged them with his bare hands. Luckily my lobby guard saw him and got the incident on camera and informed me.

You can tell from my old review below that I was a major fan of Zomato, the app and it’s service. But I’m unfortunately their service has dropped drastically.
If you order has an issue, you will not get much help, not like it used to be.
Sad to say, but you are better off trusting your food order with another service provider. The app is great for discovery, but don’t get swayed by the deals.
At the end of the day, service does matter.

Old review
Been a long time user of Zomato. It's a great app for foodies and restaurants. It's also great for food bloggers and photographers.
Zomato keeps changing the interface which is annoying at times but, once you get used to it their features starting showing.
They used to have a cashless payment system, which was discontinued unfortunately. It showed great promise.
Their table booking feature and online ordering system is quite nice as well (tho you will find inconsistencies every now and then).
Also the stats seem bloated, I have far too many views on my reviews and pics. I feel like every time someone views a restaurant (even if they don't check the review) it counts as a view. They need to fix that.
The rest of the app, I am a fan of.",2,False,Tan D,Keeps getting better,

2002,2020-03-11 08:44:44,"I encountered both of these incredible and efficient people just for 2 different orders from one same restaurant (surprisingly). First time, I received literally burnt, inedible, complete black chicken from Japang. Immediately, called the number from the receipt, the guy from restaurant’s call center promised me to deliver just the chicken ( I didn’t even asked anything more from my set menu since only all the chicken pieces came wrong) which I paid for it after asking me the picture and evidence of their burnt chicken from WhatsApp. As believing they will deliver the new one, I didn’t order any other food and fall asleep, wake up next morning, the chicken was not here. That’s where I met with Radhika from your team who is very efficient and helped me to get my food back although it took two days because I contacted the restaurant first. But my boyfriend is insanely in love with their chicken which I admit too, we kept ordering again and again until last night, the order were never arrived to us. Payment was done from my card, the restaurant was still opened when I ordered my food but nothing came to us or informed us. Just took money and marked as delivered after an hour. Again, Sharad is helpful, friendly, very empathy for us. He promised us that he will bring this issue to respective team but I just want to make sure my zomato experience smoother and more convenient. You guys definitely need to action needful control regarding with food and service when it comes to the restaurant from your side. At the end of the day, it’s Japang restaurant which I ordered through zomato, not just the restaurant name. Amazing experiences that I fought two days for chicken two times. However, I highly appreciate what your team has done for us but should be better if these things never happen since from the start. Thank you.",5,False,Phegene,Thumbs up for both Sharad and Radhika from Zomato Chat Team,

The delivery guy did not inform me in advance and communicate with me properly. Because of his cancellation, I could not get my food and Zomato did not give me a refund. Talking to customer service, they flatly said it was my fault the delivery guy couldn't deliver because I didn't answer the phone. But that's not the case, I have sent many messages with the delivery guy, including once again sending him the correct location and the correct address, he keeps circling around me and just can't find my location, it's not my fault. I have tried so hard to explain my location to him but he just can't find it. Nor did he talk to me about what he should do to help him, and he immediately cancelled my order. When I called with customer service, I said I just wanted a refund or to have my food redelivered by a new delivery guy and she just hung up the phone directly and was soooo rude! After talking to them a bunch of times in the end it didn't solve my problem. I just lost my money 900 rupees and time.

On top of that, I kept being told from the ZOMATO customer associate that I dealt with, that ZOMATO isn’t accountable for this and all they can do is raise a complaint. There was a lot of defensiveness in the associate’s tone, lack of empathy and left me feeling let down from all ends. ZOMATO has to reconsider their customer service approach and offer short term solutions rather than just say a complaint will be lodged. This is not the first time a complaint has been raised to ZOMATO and no change has come out of it. Orders continued to be canceled after being accepted and the blame is on the restaurant but ZOMATO doesn’t seem to want to change the policy in preventing these cancellations from happening and not impact their customers.  We, customers continue to experience bad experiences like cancellation of orders due to either various restaurant’s reasons or ZOMATO not having delivery staff. It’s absolutely baffling that the associates fronting the job to calm customers don’t come across as empathetic nor seem patient to understand the underlying need for change in policy from ZOMATO’s end to prevent cancellation of orders to happen. Instead, like today, we’re stuck with a back to back chat with an associate who was more defensive of their current policy and seem almost irritated with the customers for raising up concerns and wasting their time.

The restaurant name is BelBalady, UAE. A few days later, I get a mail from Zomato that they have taken down my review saying it’s not the restaurant’s fault and there was error occurred from Zomato’s end. So it’s not right to penalize the restaurant. Fine if that was the case, did you think about the inconvenience the customer faced in all this? You take down my review and give the wrong order. If Zomato considers serving their customers as their first priority, it’s shocking to say their actions speak otherwise. I have sent numerous emails to the Zomato help desk. Followed them up for the past 5 months, wasting my time describing my experience, my detailed description of the order and the Order ID and I get no response! It’s like all the emails from their customers are directed to their trash box. All I wanted was a refund for the inconvenience faced but NO Zomato doesn’t care about customer experience even though it’s built on that very foundation. All it cares about is showing a pretty face on the Internet that is the best food delivery service out there. But there are lot of great competitors who are doing a  better job! 
 
I wonder if the are even paying attention to their customer reviews given here. Because all I see their developer’s response is share your Order ID and detailed review via mail and everyone’s doing that but Zomato doesn’t respond!
I have even contacted the Zomato Community and the UAE help desk. Such terrible Zomato service in the UAE? Unbelievable. I expected more.
